## Introduction

### Game Summary

"You are responsible for setting an exeperimental bacteria colony free. Unfortunately, said colony replicates at an unprecedented speed. Double unfortunately, its favorite food is meat! You better make use of that energy core and get out of there!"

The game revolves around a rapidly spreading bacteria colony which the player character is responsible for. They then have to escape the premises by going through fast-paced platforming challenges. The movement tries to be as fluid as possible to encourage going fast.

### Inspiration

- *Downwell* is the primary source of the artstyle and simple gameplay. It only uses a few colors uses those to indicate dangers and pickups.
- *Pizza Tower* has easily mastered the art of designing controls for 2D platformers that allow you to go *really fast*.
